This is a Native application for community updates. Its is for community members to receive instant updates about events happening in their community. It will be used for community stokvels and services payment.

The app is built using React Native and Java. On the back end, it uses Firebase database for instant notifications and storing data.

A user can register and be part of the community; however, the user has to be accepted/approved to access all features in a particular community. If the user is not accepted in the community, he/she can only see the updates that are public.
